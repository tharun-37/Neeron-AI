"""
Bug condition exploration tests for the memory write-barrier.

These tests originally FAILED on the UNFIXED kernel - their failure
is what confirmed the bug exists.  Now that the kernel-level write
barrier is wired into ``MemoryManager`` (release on commit) and
``ContextInjector`` (inline waits before each retrieval), all three
cases PASS on the fixed code.

Case 1 was updated to stamp ``barrier_snapshot`` on the retrieve
syscall (replicating what ``SyscallExecutor`` does in production);
without this stamp the barrier wait short-circuits to BYPASSED.

Three exploration cases are encoded:

Case 1 (Explicit Retrieval Race) - PASSES post-fix
    A ``create_memory(user_id=alex)`` write is parked inside the
    slow provider gate.  A second agent issues
    ``retrieve_memory(user_id=alex)`` through
    ``manager.address_request`` with a ``barrier_snapshot`` stamp.
    The retrieval blocks until the write drains, then returns
    the committed memory.

Case 2 (Auto-Inject Race) - PASSES post-fix
    Two ``create_memory(user_id=alex, sharing_policy=shared)`` writes
    are parked.  ``AssistantAgent`` runs ``ContextInjector.inject``;
    the assertion encodes the post-fix expectation that both shared
    memories are reflected in the injection diagnostics
    (``injected_count == 2``, ``source_agents == [ProfileAgent,
    TaskAgent]``).  ``ContextInjector._await_pending_writes`` blocks
    until the writes drain.

Case 3 (Auto-Inject Multi-Writer) - PASSES post-fix
    A Hypothesis strategy varies ``(num_writes, jitter_ms)`` and
    asserts ``injected_count == num_writes`` after a delayed release.
    The cross-agent inline wait drains every parked write before the
    shared retrieval runs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBSERVED COUNTEREXAMPLES ON UNFIXED CODE
(captured by running this test against the pre-fix kernel - see
.kiro/specs/memory-write-barrier/tasks.md task 1):

- Case 1: retrieve_memory(user_id=alex) returned 0 search_results
  while a single create_memory(user_id=alex) was parked at the
  slow provider gate.
    AssertionError: 0 != 1 : BUG: retrieve_memory(user_id=alex)
    returned 0 results while a create_memory(user_id=alex) was
    parked at the provider.  Expected 1 (write-before-read order).

- Case 2: ContextInjector.inject() returned
  diagnostics["injected_count"] == 0 and
  diagnostics["source_agents"] == [] while two parked shared
  writes for user_id=alex were in flight.
    AssertionError: 0 != 2 : BUG: ContextInjector saw
    injected_count=0 while two parked shared writes for
    user_id=alex were in flight.  Expected 2 (auto-inject wait
    for pending writes).

- Case 3: Hypothesis falsified the property at
  ``test_case3_auto_inject_multi_writer(num_writes=2,
  jitter_ms=0)``.
    AssertionError: 0 != 2 : BUG: injected_count=0 with
    num_writes=2, jitter_ms=0.  Expected 2 after barrier drain.

These observations confirm root cause analysis items 1-3 in
design.md ("Hypothesized Root Cause"): no pending-write registry,
no acceptance-time ordering hook, and direct provider calls from
ContextInjector that bypass any future syscall-level barrier.
